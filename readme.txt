We answer questions related to usage, implementation, and customization of MusicIDB Events Calendar. We cannot guarantee resolutions for issues that may be due to custom theme code or 3rd party plugin conflicts & compatibility.

= What calendar options are available?  How can I add my MusicIDB Events from within a template? =

To add MusicIDB Events from a theme template, you can use code like this wrapped in PHP tags:
	                            
    musicidb_events(array(
        'theme' => 'light',
        'view' => 'list',
        'descrip' => 'true',
        'display' => 'img'
    ));   

The passed array parameter names and values are exactly the same as the shortcode attributes, and can be copied from the shortcode generator.

Here are the available parameters, all of which can be configured in the shortcode generator.

id: venue:123,artist:123,venue:456
Used to specify the entities you wish to list events for. Should be a comma separated string. Can be generated with shortcode generator.

numevents: Integer
Maximum number of events to load, per page, in the Event List (default is 15).

theme: light or dark
If you have a dark background, use dark and your MusicIDB events will be styled to match your theme better.  Use light if you have a white or light background color.

= What featured events slider options are available?  How can I add the MusicIDB Featured Events slider from within a template? =

To add MusicIDB Featured Events from a theme template, you can use code like this wrapped in PHP tags:

    musicidb_featured_events(array(
        'ticketdefault' => 'https://website.com/tickets',
        'leftflag' => 'Featured Events',
        'titlesize' => '22',
        'numevents' => '8',
        'background' => '#000000',
        'fallbackimage' => 'https://website.com/image.jpg',
    ));  

Shortcode version example: [musicidb-featured-slider titleSize="22" numevents="8" background="#000000" fallbackImage="https://website.com/image.jpg" leftFlag="Featured Events" ticketDefault="https://website.com/tickets"]

titlesize: Integer
Font size for title of event (Which includes automatically printed names of tagged artists)

numevents: Integer

background: Hex Code
Background color behind text, over image.  Will automatically become partially translucent.

fallbackimage: URL
An image to be used for this featured event slide when the featured event image, event poster, and artist photos attached to tagged artists are not found. 

= How do I get the artist videos and music to appear? =

There are over 10,000 artists currently listed on MusicIDB, many of which already have media attached to their artist listing. If you are entering a new artist, you can add their media by searching for them after tagging them on an event, then edit their Artist Library on MusicIDB.com and include the embed code from their media channels such as YouTube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, etc.

Our team spends time each week improving the database, so in some cases you might find we have helped fill in missing information or media for certain artists. 

Artists can also choose to update their own listings at their leisure, so they can contribute their latest release to their page, giving your website visitors the best possible experience to intice visitors to attend events.

= Can I customize the list templates? =

Yes! The plugin first checks a child theme, followed by a parent theme, and finally falls back to the templates provided in the plugin. 

Inside of your theme, create a directory called 'musicidb-calendar'. Then copy the template that you want to override into that directory. The list templates are in the plugin directory, under wp-content/plugins/musicidb-calendar, and the files you can override are: 

* musicidb-compact-events-list.php
* musicidb-full-events-list.php
* musicidb-event-detail.php
